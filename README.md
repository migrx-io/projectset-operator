# projectset-operator

The ProjectSet Operator creates/configures/manages K8s/OpenShift namespaces

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Install on cluster 

1. Install Operator and all CRs

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/migrx-io/projectset-operator/main/config/manifests.yaml
```

2. Create secret with GitHub/GitLab token (for ProsetSetSync to sync CRDs from git repo)

```sh
 kubectl create secret generic projectsetsync-secret \                                        
      --namespace projectset-operator-system \                                                          
      --from-literal=token=<GIT_TOKEN>

```


## Development

### Install CRDs
Install Operator Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
make install
```

### Run operator locally
To run operator locally 

```sh
make run
```
### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make generate
make manifests
make helm  # generate new all-in-one manifests.yaml
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)


### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

## Build and deploy/undeploy

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/projectset-operator:tag
```
